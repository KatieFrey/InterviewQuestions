/*
Your goal is to create a "Duck Duck Goose" simulator!

Given a list of "players" and a list of "duck" calls per round - ie. how many times "duck" is called before the player who gets "goose" is eliminated from the round

Create a function that can tell you the "winner" will be, ie. the last person standing.

The list of duck calls should be one less than the list of participants. Play through each round and eliminate one player each time, going in a cycle.

Example:

const team = ['hyung', 'linda', 'ani', 'serge', 'james', 'jose'];

const calls = [3,2,1,4,3]

//serge, jose, hyung, linda, ani are out in this order -- James should be winner
